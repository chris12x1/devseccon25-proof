# DevSecCon25 Challenge – Proof of Completion

This repository contains verification artifacts for my participation in the **DevSecCon25 Security Challenge**, including the solution script and supporting evidence.

This repository is intended for **proof and validation**, not as a polished production project.

---

## 🛡️ Challenge Overview

- **Event:** DevSecCon25
- **Challenge Type:** Timed security / DevSecOps automation challenge
- **Objective:** Programmatically retrieve challenge data, compute the correct ordered response, and submit it back to the API within the allowed time constraints.

---

## 🧠 Solution Summary

The solution uses a Python script to:

1. Retrieve challenge data from the provided API endpoint
2. Normalize and analyze the shuffled input
3. Determine the correct canonical ordering (based on OWASP Top 10 for LLMs)
4. Automatically submit the computed result back to the challenge API

The script demonstrates:
- API interaction
- Data normalization and matching
- Automation under time constraints
- Practical Python usage for security challenges
